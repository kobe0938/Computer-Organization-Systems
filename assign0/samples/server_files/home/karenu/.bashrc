# Nice work finding this hidden file!  But this might not be the file you're
# looking for.  This is a (blank) "shell" file containing any terminal
# commands the user would like to execute when your myth command-line session begins.
# It looks like this user has a blank one!
#
# While we won't be using .bashrc files in CS107, here is some more information if
# you're interested.  Your .bashrc file is located at ~/.bashrc.  This file is used for
# helpful things, like:
#
# - changing your prompt text (the text that is displayed in your
# terminal that prompts you to type terminal commands).  By default, on myth
# this is usually something like "troccoli@myth61:~$", but you can change 
# it by adding the following line:
#
#	PS1="yourprompttexthere: "
#
# If you do this, the next time you log in to myth, instead of
#
#	troccoli@myth61:~$ 
#
# you'll see
#
#	yourprompttexthere:
#
# You can also do other things, like defining things called "aliases",
# or change things called "environment variables".  Search online for more
# information about these, and other things you can do in your .bashrc file.
