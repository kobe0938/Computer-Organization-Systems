; Nice work finding this hidden file!  But this might not be the file you're
; looking for.  This is a (blank) configuration file used for the Emacs text
; editor.  It looks like this user is an Emacs user!

; For information for how you can use Emacs, check out the Resources page of
; the course website.  In particular, make sure you follow the instructions to
; download the Emacs configuration file we provide in CS107 so you can have one
; too.  With our configuration file, you can take advantage of convenient
; features like indenting and mouse controls.
