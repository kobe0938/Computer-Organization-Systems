DISCLOSURE AND PARTIALITY CASE STUDY
1) He follows the process by first contact steward of the internet's DNS system.
Then informs him about the vulnerability and gather more people secretly to
prepare for the fixing process. Then negotiates a reasonable timeline for a patch or fix
and announce it at BlackHat.
Given the context, he might have the Impartial Benevolence: same moral responsibilities
towards all people.

2) I think the government should also to take the partiality that Impartial Benevolence:
same moral responsibilities towards all people. Because all people over the world have the
right to have their digital data safe and protected. They should not be compromised by
another orgnization or countries by any causes. On the contrary, countries should protect
and treat humankind as a whole.

3) I would always conduct the Impartial Benevolence: same moral responsibilities
towards all people. For example, I go to help other irrelevent people and help
educate poor children in the mountain area. Because I just consider that we should
help each as humankind and this is the right thing to do.
